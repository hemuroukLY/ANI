"""kb-service NATS rebuild consumer (P1 #24, B6).

Consumes messages from ``ani.tasks.kb.rebuild.v1`` (routed there by the
OutboxDispatcher's ``subject_overrides`` for event_type ``kb.rebuild``)
and executes the full-KB re-parse: every ready/failed document in the
KB is reset and re-parsed sequentially.

Transport is a JetStream durable push consumer (ManualAck) on the
ANI_TASKS WorkQueue stream — at-least-once delivery, per the deploy
contract (component-contracts/nats.yaml) and the Go message_bus
Subscribe path. Ack semantics (see app/consumers/jetstream.py):
handler success → Ack, invalid JSON → Ack (poison pill swallowed; the
durable outbox row stays as the operator's source of truth), unhandled
crash → neither Ack nor Nak (silent for ack_wait redelivery — the
redelivery takes over the orphan task via mark_running's expired-lease
path). While a rebuild runs, an InProgress heartbeat (ack_wait/3)
renews the delivery lease so a long rebuild is never redelivered
mid-run.

Default OFF — started only when ``settings.kb_rebuild_consumer_enabled``
is True (main.py gates startup on this flag, mirroring the parse
consumer rollout).

Design decisions (B6 plan):
  - Serial execution (Semaphore(1), D5): a rebuild is a heavy long job;
    documents are processed one at a time so one rebuild never competes
    with itself for pool connections or rag-engine capacity.
  - Per-document reset (D1): each document is reset via
    ``reset_for_reparse_in_tx`` immediately before its
    ``process_document`` call — NOT in one bulk UPDATE. Queries keep
    being served from the existing (old) chunks/vector index while the
    rebuild runs; the orchestrator's built-in re-entrant cleanup removes
    the old chunks per document.
  - The orchestrator's ready-skip (parse_status == 'ready') would defeat
    the rebuild — the reset to 'pending' happens first, so the skip
    never fires; the orchestrator itself is untouched (zero changes
    below this layer).
  - No checkpoint/resume (D5): a crashed rebuild leaves the async_tasks
    row pending (or the KB stuck rebuilding); the client retries with a
    fresh idempotency key (revive semantics: a failed task is not
    replayed on the same key, SPEC §5.4).

Payload shape (from kb-service outbox_events, RebuildKB servicer)::

    {"kb_id", "tenant_id", "task_id"}

Idempotency (at-least-once): a redelivered rebuild message is gated
by ``mark_running`` (pending → running conditional UPDATE, with an
expired-lease takeover path for orphaned running rows). If the
task is still pending (first delivery crashed before marking), or
its running lease has expired (consumer died mid-run), the rebuild
runs; if the task is running under a live lease or already
terminal, the message is a duplicate and skipped entirely. Within
one run,
``list_documents_for_rebuild`` only returns ready/failed docs, so
already-rebuilt (ready) docs are re-reset and re-parsed — this is
the point of a rebuild. Documents deleted between snapshot and
processing are skipped (reset matches 0 rows / process_document
returns early).

KB status lifecycle: the consumer is the only writer of the
rebuilding → active exit transition (``set_status_in_tx``), in a
``finally`` so a crashed handler still restores the KB to active (the
async_tasks row stays failed; the KB must not stay locked forever).
