"""kb-service NATS parse consumer (Plan step 6, issue-033).

Replaces the rag-engine ``parse_worker`` NATS consumer for the parse
pipeline. Consumes messages from ``ani.tasks.kb.parse.v2`` (a distinct
subject from the legacy ``ani.tasks.kb.parse``, Plan §0.3) and dispatches
each to ``ParseOrchestrator.process_document``.

Transport is a JetStream durable push consumer (ManualAck) on the
ANI_TASKS WorkQueue stream — at-least-once delivery, per the deploy
contract (component-contracts/nats.yaml) and the Go message_bus
Subscribe path. Ack semantics (see app/consumers/jetstream.py):
success → Ack, invalid JSON → Ack (poison pill swallowed; the durable
outbox row keeps the audit trail), unhandled crash → neither Ack nor
Nak (silent for ack_wait redelivery — a redelivery simply re-runs the
pipeline from the top, which self-heals: the orchestrator's re-entrant
chunk cleanup and the ready-skip make the second pass idempotent).
While a parse runs, an InProgress heartbeat (ack_wait/3) renews the
delivery lease so a long parse is never redelivered mid-run.

Default OFF — started only when ``settings.kb_parse_consumer_enabled`` is
True (main.py gates startup on this flag). The Outbox Dispatcher publishes
to the v2 subject only when the flag is on, so the consumer and the
dispatcher stay in sync.

Idempotency (SPEC §5.4 at-least-once):
  - Duplicate messages do not cause duplicate parses. ``ParseOrchestrator``
    checks ``parse_status == 'ready'`` before doing any work (see
    parse_orchestrator.py ``process_document`` idempotency guard), so a
    redelivered message for an already-ingested document is a no-op.
  - The ``pending → parsing`` UPDATE also doubles as a row-existence check;
    a document that was deleted between publish and consume is skipped
    (the orchestrator returns early when the UPDATE matches 0 rows).

Payload shape (from kb-service outbox_events, SPEC §6.1)::

    {"doc_id", "kb_id", "storage_path", "tenant_id",
     "object_id", "file_name", "chunk_size", "task_id"}

``task_id`` (optional) references the async_tasks row created by
NotifyDocumentUploaded / ReparseDocument; when present the consumer
closes it (completed/failed) once the document reaches a terminal
parse_status. Messages without it (pre-change) keep the old behavior.

The consumer additionally resolves ``file_type`` and ``vector_store_id``
from the database (they are not carried in the outbox payload) before
calling the orchestrator:
  - ``file_type``: read from ``kb_documents`` (written by
    GetDocumentUploadURL / NotifyDocumentUploaded).
  - ``vector_store_id``: read from ``knowledge_bases`` (set by CreateKB).

        guard makes this idempotent under at-least-once redelivery: a second

        no audit row. Audit failures roll the close back together with the
        audit write — _handle leaves the message unacked and the redelivery
        retries both atomically.

        The audit write is an in-place UPDATE of the intent row written at
        task creation (located via the task_id inside its after_state):
        error_code flips to PARSE_FAILED on failure (stays NULL on success)
        and after_state is JSONB-merged with the terminal parse_status /
        chunk_count. Only if no intent row carries this task_id (rows
        written by an older build, or the audit was skipped at notify
        time) does it fall back to a separate result INSERT so the trail
